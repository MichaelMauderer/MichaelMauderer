# Michael Mauderer

I'm a software engineer specializing in visual computing and data systems. I build high-performance applications that transform complex information into clear, interactive experiences. My work ranges from graphics engines and real-time data pipelines to scientific computing libraries and developer tools.

My background bridges research and engineering. I've contributed to open-source projects like Colour (a comprehensive Python color science library), developed visual programming environments, and built eye-tracking systems that augment human perception in real time. From AR/VR applications to automotive interfaces, I focus on systems that handle demanding performance requirements while remaining intuitive to use.
